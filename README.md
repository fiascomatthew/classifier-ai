# Iris Classifier AI

## Description

This project is a simple web-based application that uses machine learning (via the **ml5.js** library) to classify the species of Iris flowers based on their physical measurements. The user can input the sepal and petal lengths and widths, and the AI will predict the species of the Iris flower (e.g., setosa, versicolor, or virginica). The classifier is trained using a synthetic Iris dataset.

Key features of this project:
- Utilizes a **neural network** for classification via the **ml5.js** library.
- Interactive UI where users can input measurements and see real-time predictions.
- AI model is trained dynamically when the user clicks the **Train the AI** button.

## Features
- **Training AI**: Allows users to train the neural network model with a synthetic dataset.
- **Form Submission**: After training, users can input Iris flower measurements (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) to classify the species.
- **Real-time Classification Results**: Once the form is submitted, the predicted Iris species is displayed.
